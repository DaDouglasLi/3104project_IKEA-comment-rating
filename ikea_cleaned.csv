I have slept on both mattresses for an extended period of time, and the more expensive VALEVÅG mattress is too soft and causes back and neck aches. Don't be fooled by the so-called compartmentalised body support. It adds no value.

Choose VESTERÖY mattress instead. Better body support, to prevent backache.

Note that IKEA mattresses are slightly bigger than the standard sizes (to make you buy IKEA bedsheets). Regular bedsheets can fit but a little tight.

To confirm my suspicion that the mattress was the cause, I began sleeping in a different room on another bed. Within 3–4 months, my back pain noticeably improved and eventually subsided. This clearly indicated that the mattress had deteriorated in quality and was no longer suitable for proper back support.

At glance, the mattress appears to be well made and comfortable.

When you press with your hand it goes down as if is soft and when you lie down in store (for maybe 5 min or 10) you feel you can do it!

I think the layer of foam on top of the springs may be too thin.

Well, a whole night of sleep is a very different story: lying down after a few hours, the body starts aching, and keeps aching...And the body stays aching next day, then you go to bed again, and the ache never goes away and builds up.

Then I bough an Ikea mattress top trying to fix the problem.

The cause seems to be the “comfort zones.” The mattress has softer spots for your shoulders and hips, with the idea being that this will relieve pressure. And it can—I have noticed reduced pain in my hip some nights—but you must situate yourself in exactly the right spot on the bed (top to bottom) so that your hip is in the softer spot and the firmer spot is at your waist. First, it’s hard to find that exact right spot. Second, I find that if I move even slightly out of the “correct” spot, I will wake up with serious middle-back pain.

The customer service team was incredibly helpful and quickly switched it to an extra-firm model, although I was fustrated that I had to pay an additional fee. The new extra-firm mattress arrived, and while it is definitely firmer, one side seems like it's already been used. There's a faint body impression on that side, which is puzzling since I ordered a brand-new mattress. My guess is that it might have been a returned mattress that someone had already slept on for a while that was resold. On the positive side, the other side without the body impression is fantastic and super comfortable. So, I guess id recommend the extra-firm option, but you're just going to have to hop you get one that’s actually brand new.

 Three years ago I got one queen and one twin size Haugnsvar mattress and they are perfect..Since then I was waiting for them to come on sale so I will get another new two mattresses for my sons bedrooms.. unfortunately I did buy it but this time I didn't find it under the same name but with the same specs I got this one thinking it's the same as Haugnsvar ! it claims Hybrid, firm,thickness!! But it has nothing to do with the old version and it's NOT firm at all ..I can literally feel the springs the moment I sat on it ..we are sooooo disappointed after all the wait we made!

However, within a few months, the springs began to make an unbearable noise with every little movement. Whether I’m turning over, getting in and out of bed, shifting slightly the creaking and squeaking is constant. it also wakes up my partner throughout the night.What’s most frustrating is that it’s hard to ignore the sound once it starts. It feels like the springs inside are either loose or of very poor quality. This makes the mattress uncomfortable because you can’t relax without being distracted by the noise. I was expecting much better durability, especially since the mattress is still relatively new.I’ve tried to adjust the frame and even placed the mattress on a different surface to see if that would help, but the noise persists. For the price I paid, I expected it to last longer before showing signs of wear. Unfortunately, I can’t recommend this mattress to anyone looking for a quiet, peaceful sleep.

So i went to the store looking for something similar and tried all of the showroom mattresses. 

Most mattresses in store felt too soft and cushy. I was looking for something quite firm as i have a stuffed back from sleeping on latex for the last decade. I needed hip support badly.

The only two which i felt came close to Hovag was this one in extra firm and the pricier vatnestrom in extra firm.

Was happy to discover that this is vacuum roll packed and was easy to transport home in my car with the seats down flat. If you want to save money on shipping and can get down to a store, this is a good way to save some money. It is quite heavy though.

Ive had this mattress for 2 weeks now and i find it comfortable, supportive and not too hot. It also doesn’t jiggle and shake when my husband rolls around. Definitely recommend.",,False,True,False,4,0,2023-02-17 01:29:53+00:00,2023-05-02 07:25:16+00:00,art,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Jenn,5.0,0.0,0.0

It's close but not quite.
While it's comfortable once you're horizontal on it, the edges are so soft, i.e. no structure other than the foam and coils underneath, that you cannot sit on the edge of it. The Haugsvar was truly the better mattress.
I'm giving the Vagstranda only 3 stars for that reason, but if you're OK with the soft edges, it is truly very comfortable. 
I wish we could have kept the Haugsvar. 
Don't get me wrong, half of everything I own came from IKEA, and I have never been disappointed with the quality. Love the products. Love the space-saving designs. Just disappointed with this particular item's lack of equivalence.

The manufacturing date was also a year old, which was unexpected.
More importantly, the mattress is nowhere near as firm as the showroom model we tested. It lacks support, and the surface feels unstable—making it easy to roll off. For a product marketed as firm, this is a major letdown and a potential safety concern.
Given that we live 2.5 hours away, returning it is inconvenient, but the quality and possible used condition make it unacceptable.

As others have said the edge sinks a bit when you sit on it, although that has not bothered me when I slept.

Now I don’t know much about making a mattress… so just take it as it is… Notice how Haugsvar is a thicker mattress at 11in yet Anneland is thinner at 9 1/2in. Yet Haugsvar is still significantly more affordable than Anneland. So I thought maybe it’s the materials. NOPE. Haugsvar is composed of cotton, polyester, viscose/rayon, and polyurethane foam. Anneland is polyester, polypropylene, viscose, and polyurethane foam. We lost the cotton compound which costs more to produce than viscose, and it more durable. The only thing viscose is better for in this mattress is that it’s a bit more breathable than cotton and sustainable to produce. Yet if cotton costs more, why am I paying more for cheaper made and thinner mattress? Yeah no thank you, it explains why others don’t like Anneland.
